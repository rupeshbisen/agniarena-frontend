## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `dev` - Development branch for integration
- Feature branches - Named descriptively (e.g., `feature/live-scoring`, `fix/video-player-bug`)

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Ensure your main branch is up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Test your changes locally
3. Ensure all quality checks pass (see [Code Quality Standards](#code-quality-standards))
4. Commit your changes (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines))
5. Push to your fork
6. Open a pull request

## Code Quality Standards

Before submitting your changes, ensure they meet our quality standards:

### Run All Quality Checks

```bash
npm run quality
```

This command runs:
- Format checking with Prettier
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Linting with ESLint

### Individual Quality Checks

**Format Code**
```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Auto-fix formatting
npm run format
```

**Type Check**
```bash
npm run type-check
```

**Lint Code**
```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

**Build Project**
```bash
npm run build
```

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React and Next.js best practices
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit messages for clarity and consistency:

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes

### Examples

```bash
feat(scoring): Add real-time score updates via WebSocket

fix(video): Resolve HLS stream playback issue on mobile

docs(readme): Update installation instructions

chore(deps): Update Next.js to version 16.1.3
```

### Tips

- Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Use the body to explain what and why, not how
